Expo comes with an app for ios and android so you can see your app in native device with native code, so let’s install expo first with:\n\n```\nnpm install -g expo-cli\nexpo init Pigpen-cipher\n\n```\n\nWith expos basic tab example, I already had a working app with tabs. The idea was to have two different tabs for encrypting and decrypting the message.  \nAfter a couple of hours, I was done and could see my app in the browser by running:\n\n```\nexpo start --web \n```\n\nEverything worked great and I saved all my cipher as svg it into the app. but when I started looking at the app in native ios environment I could see that my svg is not showing up. after googling for hours and trying different libraries I got back to the original react-native-svg and converted my svg to Svg react component. but still no luck! after looking around and playing with the code for about one hour I found the problem. I forgot to set the width &amp; height for each svg.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"giphy-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/6xcqPF9MTwChq\" width=\"480\"></iframe>\n\nAfter that everything worked as it should, you can click on the symbols to decrypting a message or write your text and encrypting it.  \nThe next step would be to make it so you can save your encrypted message as an image so you can send it to your friend.\n\nBefore that “Git push”. You can see and download the app on [my Github](https://github.com/ehsanpo/Pigpen-cipher).  \nNext, I will use [react-native-view-shot](https://github.com/gre/react-native-view-shot) and [react-native-cameraroll](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-cameraroll) to convert the Svg react component to an image and save it to the camera roll.

The best option is to choose an administrator username which consists of random characters and use a different nickname. WPScan scans for usernames in the URL’s so if you won’t use the username it cannot be scanned by WPScan. Another way to prevent user enumeration is to use a different account to publish posts and answer to replies.\n\n### How to avoid Wordpres password brute forcing\n\nThe best way to keep attackers using brute force methods out is to limit the login attempts for and IP address. There are several plug-ins available for WordPress to limit the number login attempts for a specific username and IP, such as Wordfence. The latest WordPress versions have the option to limit login attempts by default. Make sure you limit entries to a maximum of 3 and increase lock out time a lot after 2 lock outs (which is 6 password attempts)."},{"slug":"/notes//what-is-twitch","data":{"title":"What is Twitch?","date":"2019-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","status":"publish","permalink":"/what-is-twitch","author":"Ehsan","excerpt":"","type":"post","id":1364,"thumbnail":"../uploads/2019/06/Gaming.jpg","category":["Design"],"tag":["Streaming"],"post_format":[],"fileName":"what-is-twitch"},"content":"Twitch is a prominent online streaming video.\n\nTwitch streams can be seen on the official Twitch site and through one of the numerous formal Twitch applications which are accessible for iOS and Android gadgets, Xbox, PlayStation, and countless other viewing choices.

Browser’s with “incognito” or “private window” don’t accurately cut it. On the off chance that you need absolute anonymity, you’re going to need to utilize Tor, in the past known as The Onion Router.\n\n### Tor is an Internet networking protocol\n\nIntended to anonymize the data transferred crosswise over it. Utilizing Tor’s product will make it troublesome, if certainly feasible, for any snoops to see your webmail, look up your history, social media posts, or other activity online.\nThey likewise won’t almost certainly tell which nation you’re in by breaking down your IP address, which can be valuable for journalists, activists, businesspeople and that’s only the tip of the iceberg.\n\n### How does Tor work?\n\nThe Tor system goes through the PC servers of thousands of volunteers spread all through the world. Your information is packaged into an encoded parcel when it enters the Tor network.\nTor strips away a piece of the packet’s header, which is a part of the data that could be utilized to learn things about the sender, for example, the operating system from which the message was sent.\nAt last, Tor scrambles and encrypts the remainder of the data, called the packet wrapper. Regular Internet doesn’t do this.\n\n### How would I use Tor?\n\nTo utilize Tor, you’ll need a client or software, that communicates with the Tor network.\nThe essential software is the Tor Browser Bundle, which the Tor Project distributes. The Tor Browser Bundle is preconfigured to send and get all Web traffic through the anonymizing Tor network.\nYou can design most programs to work with Tor utilizing the modules accessible in the pack. However, if you use Tor’s browser to get to the Internet, you don’t need to stress over the best possible setup.\n\nAlternatively, if you don’t know how to do this, or don’t want to get into the hassle of setting up a dark web, I offer Tor website setup, for all your needs.\n\n### OSX easy Tor setup – Bash script\n\nYou can save the script as tor.sh in your /usr/local/bin, make it executable with chmod + x and use it as a replacement for the general tor command.\nThen you can open a terminal and run\n\n```\ntor.sh\n```\n\nThe script will close the tor and change back your proxy setting when you close it.\n\n```\n\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n# 'Wi-Fi' or 'Ethernet' or 'Display Ethernet'\nINTERFACE=Wi-Fi\n\n#check if Homebrew installed\nwhich -s brew\nif [[ $? != 0 ]] ; then\n# Install Homebrew\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\nelse\nbrew update\nfi\n\n#check if tor installed\nif brew ls --versions tor > /dev/null; then\necho \"Tor is installed\"\nelse\nbrew install tor\nfi\n\n# Ask for the admin password\nsudo -v\n\n# Keep-alive: update existing `sudo` time stamp until finished\nwhile true; do sudo -n true; sleep 60; kill -0 \"$$\" || exit; done 2>/dev/null &\n\n# trap ctrl-c and call disable_proxy()\nfunction disable_proxy() {\nsudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate $INTERFACE off\necho \"$(tput setaf 64)\" #green\necho \"SOCKS proxy disabled.\"\necho \"$(tput sgr0)\" # color reset\n}\ntrap disable_proxy INT\n\n# Let's roll\nsudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxy $INTERFACE 127.0.0.1 9050 off\nsudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate $INTERFACE on\n\necho \"$(tput setaf 64)\" # green\necho \"SOCKS proxy 127.0.0.1:9050 enabled.\"\necho \"$(tput setaf 136)\" # orange\necho \"Starting Tor...\"\necho \"$(tput sgr0)\" # color reset\n\ntor\n\n```"},{"slug":"/notes//my-first-machine-learning-project","data":{"title":"My first Machine Learning project","date":"2019-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","status":"publish","permalink":"/my-first-machine-learning-project","author":"Ehsan","excerpt":"","type":"post","id":913,"thumbnail":"../uploads/2019/04/244001-1400x900-c-center.jpg","category":["Lab"],"tag":["AI","ML","Python"],"post_format":[],"fileName":"my-first-machine-learning-project"},"content":"To understand what the script does line by line\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nI have been reading a lot about AI and machine learning lately.\nBig company Like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft already offering ML and AI related services.I have played around with Google Vision and also seen services from Microsoft.

I need to install python, Tensorflow and OpenCV. I looked up some tutorials and to be honest it took me about 2 hours to run be able to run this script. I Had many problems with the python versions. but finally, after many “models missing error” I got it to run!\n\nSo where do I find all my data? Let’s Use Google image search! ?\nI used the same Google Chrome plugin (Fatkun Batch) as suggested in the article to save all the images at ones. My first searches were “Pretty girl” and “Ugly girls”. I saved the images but wait! there is a lot of things happening in the background. I only want to rate the face not the whole image! ?\n\nok, Let’s find another Script that finds the face and saves it in different files!\nCropping the faces!This was harder that i imagined some how! To get the right version of OpenCV and Python to work together took it’s time, But finally I find this:\n<https://github.com/icchi-h/face-cropping>\nI don’t even know what language the Readme is but i could see how to runt it! I tested and Woohoo! it’s worked like a charm! Some images were not even images after cropping, so I needed to delete the images that I couldn’t open,So this was the steps I took:\n\n    1. Search for “pretty girls” and “ugly girls” in Google images.\n    2. Download about 100 images using Fatkun.\n    3. Crop the faces.\n    4. Train the AI with the images.\n\nI did some test but it’s didn’t worked as I expected. It gave Angelina Jolie a 0.3 ?.\nProblems:\n\n    1. I need more data.\n    2. I need to scan every image my self and make sure every pic in pretty girl category is good.\n    3. My ugly girls are reeeeaaaally ugly, just do a search in google and you ‘ll see.\n\nThis time I did a quick search for some models and actuates I like and Angelina July in Instagram! woohoo! my pretty girl’s data is very nice! 1000 images of pretty girls! I added about 400 really ugly girls and cleaned the cropped image to remove some wrong recognized object as a face and some images of the girls when they did a funny face.\nI did not put any images of my test object in my training data.and the result was:\n\n![Kate upton](./images/kate.jpg)\nTest 1 : Kate upton\n<pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" >\nhot (score = 0.96017)\nugly (score = 0.00904)\n</pre>\n\n\n![Rihanna](./images/rihanna.jpg)\nTest 2 : Rihanna\n<pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" >\nhot (score = 0.98910)\n</pre>\n\n\n![Miley-cyrus](./images/Miley-cyrus.jpg)\nTest 3: Miley Cyrus\n<pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" >\nhot (score = 0.72287)\nugly (score = 0.01855)\n</pre>\n\n![Miley-cyrus](./images/Hillary_Clinton.jpg)\n<pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" >\nTest 4 : Hillary Clinton\nhot (score = 0.40589)\nugly (score = 0.34242)\n</pre>\n\n![Miley-cyrus](./images/IMG_1856-kopia.jpg)\n<pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\">\nTest 5: My own face\nhot (score = 0.52569)\nugly (score = 0.36819)\n</pre>\n\nI’m pretty satisfied with the result! note that my training data was the type of the face I like, Rihanna and Kate Are so beautiful and i really don’t like Miley and Hillary! And to be honest I think my own face got the fair point! 🙂\n\n### So whats next?\n\nI need some feedback, I don’t have big networks of developer that could give me the feedback’s and the one I know are too busy for this kind of basic stuff. I thought to write this article to get some feedback and **give big thanks to the open-source community for putting all the scripts out there**❤️!\nI also really would like to get started with the project that could turn the Wireframe/design to code in an open-source project! my knowledge about the AI and Ml is not that much but I learn fast and can work with the part of the project that writes the php/html/css/wordpress code.\n\n### Just do it!\n\nFinally I want to tell to those who try to learn to code, that you can learn anything! This is 2017 and there is a lot of people that share codes, just copy the code, test it, change some line and see what happens! If I cloud learn to code my self you can do it too! you only need patience!\n\n*This is my first article ever!!! So sorry for my bad english but i need to write to learn!*"}]},"__N_SSG":true}

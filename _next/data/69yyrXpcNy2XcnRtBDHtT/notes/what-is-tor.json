Browser’s with “incognito” or “private window” don’t accurately cut it. On the off chance that you need absolute anonymity, you’re going to need to utilize Tor, in the past known as The Onion Router.\n\n### Tor is an Internet networking protocol\n\nIntended to anonymize the data transferred crosswise over it. Utilizing Tor’s product will make it troublesome, if certainly feasible, for any snoops to see your webmail, look up your history, social media posts, or other activity online.\nThey likewise won’t almost certainly tell which nation you’re in by breaking down your IP address, which can be valuable for journalists, activists, businesspeople and that’s only the tip of the iceberg.\n\n### How does Tor work?\n\nThe Tor system goes through the PC servers of thousands of volunteers spread all through the world. Your information is packaged into an encoded parcel when it enters the Tor network.\nTor strips away a piece of the packet’s header, which is a part of the data that could be utilized to learn things about the sender, for example, the operating system from which the message was sent.\nAt last, Tor scrambles and encrypts the remainder of the data, called the packet wrapper. Regular Internet doesn’t do this.\n\n### How would I use Tor?\n\nTo utilize Tor, you’ll need a client or software, that communicates with the Tor network.\nThe essential software is the Tor Browser Bundle, which the Tor Project distributes. The Tor Browser Bundle is preconfigured to send and get all Web traffic through the anonymizing Tor network.\nYou can design most programs to work with Tor utilizing the modules accessible in the pack. However, if you use Tor’s browser to get to the Internet, you don’t need to stress over the best possible setup.\n\nAlternatively, if you don’t know how to do this, or don’t want to get into the hassle of setting up a dark web, I offer Tor website setup, for all your needs.\n\n### OSX easy Tor setup – Bash script\n\nYou can save the script as tor.sh in your /usr/local/bin, make it executable with chmod + x and use it as a replacement for the general tor command.\nThen you can open a terminal and run\n\n```\ntor.sh\n```\n\nThe script will close the tor and change back your proxy setting when you close it.\n\n```\n\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n# 'Wi-Fi' or 'Ethernet' or 'Display Ethernet'\nINTERFACE=Wi-Fi\n\n#check if Homebrew installed\nwhich -s brew\nif [[ $? != 0 ]] ; then\n# Install Homebrew\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\nelse\nbrew update\nfi\n\n#check if tor installed\nif brew ls --versions tor > /dev/null; then\necho \"Tor is installed\"\nelse\nbrew install tor\nfi\n\n# Ask for the admin password\nsudo -v\n\n# Keep-alive: update existing `sudo` time stamp until finished\nwhile true; do sudo -n true; sleep 60; kill -0 \"$$\" || exit; done 2>/dev/null &\n\n# trap ctrl-c and call disable_proxy()\nfunction disable_proxy() {\nsudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate $INTERFACE off\necho \"$(tput setaf 64)\" #green\necho \"SOCKS proxy disabled.\"\necho \"$(tput sgr0)\" # color reset\n}\ntrap disable_proxy INT\n\n# Let's roll\nsudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxy $INTERFACE 127.0.0.1 9050 off\nsudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate $INTERFACE on\n\necho \"$(tput setaf 64)\" # green\necho \"SOCKS proxy 127.0.0.1:9050 enabled.\"\necho \"$(tput setaf 136)\" # orange\necho \"Starting Tor...\"\necho \"$(tput sgr0)\" # color reset\n\ntor\n\n```\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
